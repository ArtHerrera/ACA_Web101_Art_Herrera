        <p class="content">What excites or interests you about coding?
                Coding to me is a complete unknown at this point. I equate it to the introduction of computers in the early 80’s & 90’s. The upcoming generation is growing up learning to code and will have a better grasp on it, and if we don’t actively seek to learn it, we will fall behind. So I guess I would say I’m interested in it to learn what is currently valued in the workplace and be ahead of the game moving forward.
                
                However, that’s not entirely why I’m interested. Truth is, I have an idea for a startup…how many times have you heard that? The answer probably lies somewhere between “A lot” and “Not Again”. Nonetheless this idea of mine is currently the main reason for wanting to learn to code. Even if it turns out to be a horrible idea and everyone hates it, I want to have the skills to build something from scratch and eventually find out for myself if it’s a horrible idea.
                
                What does <!DOCTYPE> do at the top of your code?
                To understand what the <!DOCTYPE> declaration does we need to understand what it is. It is part of a set of rules for creating a website when using HyperText Markup Language (HTML). Unlike the rest of your HTML code, <!DOCTYPE> is not a tag. Instead it acts as an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. Setting <!DOCTYPE> as the very first thing in your HTML document ensures the browser knows what type of document to expect.
                
                Explain how a browser determines what elements match a CSS selector?
                Similar to HTML, CSS also has it’s own set of rules we need to follow when writing code. Determining what elements match what selector will determine how detailed your CSS is. The browser will typically filter out elements according to the key selector.</p>
